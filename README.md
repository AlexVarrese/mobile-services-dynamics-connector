# Azure Mobile Connector SDK for Dynamics CRM Online

This repository has two SDKs, each with its own sample projects:

- :star: Use the [Mobile Services Connector SDK](MobileServicesCrm/readme.md) for apps that will go in production in the next 3-6 months. Azure Mobile Services is Generally Available with a [99.9% uptime SLA](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/mobile-services/).

- Use the [Azure Mobile Apps Connector SDK](MobileAppsCrm-preview/readme.md) to try out our new **preview service** that runs on Azure App Service. **There is no SLA for Azure Mobile Apps** and it is not currently recommended for production use. However, once Azure Mobile Apps is GA, we will encourage Mobile Services customers to migrate in order to take advantage of new features.

If you have any questions on this SDK or Azure Mobile in general, tweet [@AzureMobile](https://twitter.com/AzureMobile) or post on the [MSDN forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=azuremobile).
